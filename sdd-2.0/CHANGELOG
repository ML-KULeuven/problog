sdd version 2.0, January 8, 2018

- open source release of SDD library

- new dynamic vtree search algorithm which uses higher-level primitives

- support for X-constrained vtrees

- simplified FNF-to-SDD compiler for compiling CNF and DNF into SDD

- various fixes and updates

sdd version 1.1, November 7, 2013

- introduced Beginner-User and Advanced-User manuals

- introduced automatic garbage collection and automatic SDD
  minimization

- automatic SDD minimization can be set to invoke a user-specified
  minimization function

- introduced two versions of CNF/DNF-to-SDD compiler: one with
  automatic garbage collection and SDD minimization, and one with
  manual

- added functions to simplify garbage collection (e.g., testing for
  garbage collected nodes, conditional garbage collection calls, etc.)

- added support for weighted model counting

- added support for navigating SDDs

- added support for adding variables to a manager

- added a library version of the vtree search algorithm (SDD
  minimization algorithm)

- command line options of the CNF-to-SDD compiler have been updated,
  with new default options (initial balanced vtree, dynamic vtree
  search enabled, and automatic garbage collection and SDD
  minimization)
