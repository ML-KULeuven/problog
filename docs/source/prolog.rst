Builtins and Libraries
======================

ProbLog supports a subset of the Prolog language for expressing models in probabilistic logic.
The main difference between ProbLog's language and Prolog is that Prolog is a complete logic programming language,
whereas ProbLog is a logic representation language.
This means that most of the functionality of Prolog that is related to the programming part (such as control constructs and input/output) are not supported in ProbLog.

Available libraries
-------------------

Lists
+++++

.. _`SWI-Prolog lists library`: http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=lists

The ProbLog lists module implements all predicates from the `SWI-Prolog lists library`_: ``memberchk/2``, ``member/2``, ``append/3``, ``append/2``, ``prefix/2``, ``select/3``, ``selectchk/3``, ``select/4``, ``selectchk/4``, ``nextto/3``, ``delete/3``, ``nth0/3``, ``nth1/3``, ``nth0/4``, ``nth1/4``, ``last/2``, ``proper_length/2``, ``same_length/2``, ``reverse/2``, ``permutation/2``, ``flatten/2``, ``max_member/2``, ``min_member/2``, ``sum_list/2``, ``max_list/2``, ``min_list/2``, ``numlist/3``, ``is_set/1``, ``list_to_set/2``, ``intersection/3``, ``union/3``, ``subset/2``, ``subtract/3``.

In addition to these, the ProbLog library provides the following:

``select_uniform(+ID, +Values, ?Value, ?Rest)``
    ...

``select_weighted(+ID, +Weights, +Values, ?Value, ?Rest)``
    ...

``groupby(?List, ?Groups)``
    ...

``sub_list(?List, ?Before, ?Length, ?After, ?SubList)``
    ...

``enum_groups(+Groups, +Values, -Group, -GroupedValues)``
    ...

``enum_groups(+GroupValues, -Group, -GroupedValues)``
    ...

``unzip(ListAB,ListA,ListB)``
    ...

``zip(ListA,ListB,ListAB)``
    ...

``make_list(Len,Elem,List)``
    ...


Apply
+++++

.. _`SWI-Prolog apply library`: http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=apply

The ProbLog lists module implements all predicates from the `SWI-Prolog apply library`_: ``include/3``, ``exclude/3``, ``partition/4``, ``partition/5``, ``maplist/2``, ``maplist/3``, ``maplist/4``, ``maplist/5``, ``convlist/3``, ``foldl/4``, ``foldl/5``, ``foldl/6``, ``foldl/7``, ``scanl/4``, ``scanl/5``, ``scanl/6``, ``scanl/7``.


Cut
+++

ProbLog does not support cuts (``!``).
However, it does provide the cut library to help with the modeling of ordered rulesets.

This library implements a soft cut.

1. Define a set of indexed-clauses (index is first argument)

.. code-block:: prolog

    r(1, a, b).
    r(2, a, c).
    r(3, b, c).

2. Call the rule using cut where you should remove the first argument

.. code-block:: prolog

    cut(r(A, B))


This will evaluate the rules in order of their index (note: NOT order in the file)
and only ONE rule will match (the first one that succeeds).
   e.g.:

.. code-block:: prolog

    cut(r(A, B)) => A = a, B = b
    cut(r(a, X)) => X = b
    cut(r(X, c)) => X = a
    cut(r(b, X)) => X = c

The predicate cut/2 unifies the second argument with the Index of the matching rule.


Assert
++++++

The assert module allows assert and retracting facts dynamically from the internal database.

It provides the predicates ``assertz/1``, ``retract/1``, ``retractall/1``.

Record
++++++

The record module allows access to non-backtrackable storage in the internal database.

It provides the predicates ``current_key/1``, ``recorda/2``, ``recorda/3``, ``recordz/2``, ``recordz/3``, ``erase/1``, ``recorded/2``, ``recorded/3``, ``instance/2``.

Aggregate
+++++++++

The ``aggregate`` library LDL++ style of aggregation.

This functionality requires the 'aggregate' library.

.. code-block:: prolog

    :- use_module(library(aggregate)).

An aggregating clause is a clause of the form:

.. code-block:: prolog

    FUNCTOR(*GroupArgs, AggFunc<AggVar>) :- BODY.

with

- FUNCTOR: The predicate name.
- GroupArgs: (optional) list of arguments that will be used as a "group by".  That is, the clause will produce a result for each distinct set
- AggFunc: An aggregation function. This can be any binary predicate that maps a list onto a term.
- AggVar: The variable over which the aggregation is computed.
- BODY: The body of the clause.

The library provides 'sum', 'avg', 'min' and 'max', but also user-defined predicates can be used.

User defined predicates have to be /2, with a list as input and some result as output.
For example, the predicate proper_length/2 in lists fits this definition and can be used natively as an aggregation.

Examples

.. code-block:: prolog

    :- use_module(library(aggregate)).

    person(a).
    person(b).
    person(c).
    person(d).
    person(e).

    salary(a, 1000).
    salary(b, 1200).
    salary(c, 800).
    salary(d, 1100).
    salary(e, 1400).

    dept(a, dept_a).
    dept(b, dept_a).
    dept(c, dept_b).
    dept(d, dept_b).
    dept(e, dept_a).

    % Average salary per department.
    dept_salary(Dept, avg<Salary>) :- person(X), salary(X, Salary), dept(X, Dept).
    query(dept_salary(Dept, Salary)).
    % dept_salary(dept_a,1200.0) 1
    % dept_salary(dept_b,950.0) 1

    % Max salary per department.
    dept_max_salary(Dept, max<Salary>) :- person(X), salary(X, Salary), dept(X, Dept).
    query(dept_max_salary(Dept, Salary)).
    % dept_max_salary(dept_a,1400) 1
    % dept_max_salary(dept_b,1100) 1

    % Average salary company-wide.
    all_salary(avg<Salary>) :- person(X), salary(X, Salary), dept(X, Dept).
    query(all_salary(Salary)).
    % all_salary(1100.0) 1

These aggregates also support probabilistic data.


Collect
+++++++

The ``collect`` library provides the ``=>`` operator generalizing the operator ``all/3``.

The general syntax of this operator is:

.. code-block:: prolog

 ( CODEBLOCK ) => GroupBy / AggFunc(Arg1, Arg2, ..., ArgK)

with

- CODEBLOCK: A block of code parseable by Prolog
- AggFunc: An aggregation function to apply on the result of evaluating CODEBLOCK.
- Arg1, ..., ArgK: An arbitrary number of arguments to the aggregation function.
- GroupBy: An optional expression over the aggregation function should be grouped.

In order to implement the aggregation operator, the user should define a predicate

.. code-block:: prolog

 collect_AggFunc(CodeBlock, GroupBy, Arg1, Arg2, ..., ArgK, Result)

Where standard aggregation function (e.g., the functions provided by the ``aggregate`` library)
can be collected using the operator ``aggregate/5`` from the ``aggregate`` library
through

.. code-block:: prolog

 collect_AggFunc(CodeBlock, GroupBy, AggVar, AggRes) :-
     aggregate(AggFunc, AggVar, GroupBy, CodeBlock, (GroupBy, AggRes)).

Considering predicates ``cell(Row, Column, Value)`` and
``cell_type(Row, Column, Type)`` we could use ``=>`` to get the average per column
of cell values representing an integer.

e.g.:

.. code-block:: prolog

 column_average(Column, Avg) :- (
    cell(Row, Column, Value),
    type(cell(Row, Column, 'int')
 ) => Column / avg(Value, Avg).

Where ``collect_avg`` can be defined using the operator ``avg/2`` from the ``aggregate``
library

.. code-block:: prolog

 collect_avg(CodeBlock, GroupBy, AggVar, AggRes) :-
    aggregate(avg, AggVar, GroupBy, CodeBlock, (GroupBy, AggRes)).

DB
++

The ``db`` library provides access to data stored in an SQLite database or a CSV-file.
It provides two predicates:

``sqlite_load(+Filename)``
    This creates virtual predicates for each table in the database.

``sqlite_csv(+Filename, +Predicate)``
    This creates a new predicate for the data in the CSV file.

For a demonstration on how to use these, see `this tutorial article <https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/tutorial/advanced/02_knowledgebases.html>`_.


Scope
+++++


In order to manage several Problog theories in one model,
theories can be defined through the scope operator ``:/2``.
The left member of the scope is the scope name and its right member the predicate in the scope.
e.g.:

.. code-block:: prolog

 scope(1):knowledge(1).


Scopes can be manipulated as set of predicates.

e.g., the union of scopes can be generated through the ``;/2`` operator
and a whole scope can be queried through the unification of its predicates:

.. code-block:: prolog

 scope(1):a.
 scope(2):b.
 scope(3):X :- scope(1):X; scope(2):X.
 query(scope(3):_).

 result:
  scope(3):a:   1
  scope(3):b:   1

The ``scope`` library provides additional behaviours in scopes.

Conjunction reasoning, e.g.:

.. code-block:: prolog

 scope(1):a.
 scope(1):b.
 query(scope(1):(a,b)).

 result:
  scope(1):(a, b):  1

Temporary union through list, e.g.:

.. code-block:: prolog

 scope(1):a.
 scope(2):b.
 query([scope(1),scope(2)]:b).

 result:
  [scope(1), scope(2)]:b:   1

All predicates outside any scope are considered in all scopes, e.g:

.. code-block:: prolog

 a.
 query(scope(1):a).

 result:
  scope(1):a:   1

String
++++++

The ``string`` library provides predicates for string manipulation.


NLP4PLP
+++++++
