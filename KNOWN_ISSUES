Known Issues
============

This document is an overview of known issues in ProbLog and their resolution.

Issue 1: DSharp error (on Mac OSX)
----------------------------------

Compilation to d-DNNFs using the default DSharp compiler on Mac OSX can cause issues.

There are two possible solutions:

    - Use SDDs instead of d-DNNFs.
        In most cases d-DNNFs can be replaced by SDDs. 
        You can use the SDD library by installing PySDD (https://github.com/wannesm/PySDD).

        Once the library is installed, it will be used by default.
        
    - Use the Windows version of the c2d knowledge compiler through Wine.
        Instructions can be found in problog/bin/darwin/cnf2dDNNF_wine
        
        When c2d is found, it will be used automatically instead of DSharp.
        
For most cases option 1 is sufficient.


Issue 2: DSharp OSError: [Errno 8] Exec format error:
----------------------------------------------

This is caused by using the 64-bit binary on a 32-bit system.

There are two possible solutions:

    - Use a different knowledge compiler that does not have this issue (c2d or SDD).
    
    - Compile a dSharp 32-bit version (dSharp source: https://bitbucket.org/haz/dsharp/src/default/) 
    and replace the original dSharp file with it. The path can be found in the OSError message.
    Alternatively, use the 32-bit version in this zip: https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/problog/files/3448011/dsharp.zip
