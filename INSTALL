Installation instructions
=========================

ProbLog 2.2 requires Python 3.6+ since 2.1.0.36

Mac OSX and most Linux installations have Python pre-installed.
If Python is not yet installed on your system you can obtain it from 
    
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
    
For better performance you can also run ProbLog with PyPy:

    http://pypy.org/download.html

ProbLog's evaluation is based on knowledge compilation tools.
By default it uses dsharp [https://github.com/QuMuLab/dsharp/].

It also supports two other tools:
    * C2D Compiler (NNF) [http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/c2d/]
    * Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDD) [http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/sdd/]

It is recommended to install one of these alternatives (especially for Mac users).

Linux (64-bit)
--------------

SDD
+++

To be able to use SDDs, PySDD must be installed (https://github.com/wannesm/PySDD).
When installing problog with "pip install problog[sdd]", PySDD will be installed.
When installing from source, use "pip install .[sdd]"

Usage: 
ProbLog will automatically use SDDs from now on.
If you want to use d-DNNFs you can use add the command line options -k nnf.

C2D
+++
Due to licensing issues we can not distribute this tool as part of our package.

1. Download c2d from
